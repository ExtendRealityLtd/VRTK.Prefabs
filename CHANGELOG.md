### [1.1.2](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK.Prefabs/compare/v1.1.1...v1.1.2) (2019-10-29)

#### Bug Fixes

* **Locomotion:** disable snap to floor during teleport action ([7193f18](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK.Prefabs/commit/7193f18cf45485625d8aa40fc5cdeb60f9ad7c1d))
  > There was an issue where the Snap To Floor logic would run every update frame utilizing the HMD as the origin of the surface location cast, but when the PlayArea was teleported, the HMD position would not be updated until the next frame due to the underlying SDK positional update needing a frame and then for the headset alias needing to catch up.
  > 
  > This caused the Snap To Floor calculation to use the previous headset position as the origin to look for the nearest floor because the Headset alias was still at the old position at that point in the moment process.
  > 
  > The fix is to utilize the new EventProcess and when the Teleporting event is emitted to disable the SnapToFloor and the SurfaceLocator within the SnapToFloor so no floor snapping can occur whilst the teleport is in progress. Then upon the Teleported event being emitted to just turn on the SnapToFloor process but to leave the SurfaceLocator still disabled. This means the SnapToFloor MomentProcessor will do a complete run of all the moments to process and the last moment is now set to emit an event which turns on the SurfaceLocator so it is available the next time the moment processor runs.

### [1.1.1](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK.Prefabs/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1) (2019-10-28)

#### Bug Fixes

* **README.md:** provide more concise release data and update info ([e3dc1a2](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK.Prefabs/commit/e3dc1a29196f59548ecb0cfdca403444ff1e12a1))
  > The Releases section has been removed and is now just a simple badge at the top of the README. There has been an additional section in `Getting Started` on how to update the package via the Unity Package Manager.
  > 
  > The links have also been ordered in the order of appearance in the document.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK.Prefabs/compare/v1.0.7...v1.1.0) (2019-10-27)

#### Features

* **.github:** use organization .github repository ([76597fb](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK.Prefabs/commit/76597fb177972d15873382d45a87d064a9c6f1b0))
  > GitHub provides a mechanism where a global organization .github repo can be used as a fallback to provide default community health files instead of repeating the same files across multiple repos.
  > 
  > ExtendRealityLtd now has a `.github` repo which should be used as it provides the correct details for this repo.
  > 
  > The README.md has been updated to provide definitive links to the relevant files.

### [1.0.7](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK.Prefabs/compare/v1.0.6...v1.0.7) (2019-10-22)

#### Bug Fixes

* **Interactions:** interactor to emit collision stopped on disable ([34d4f2f](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK.Prefabs/commit/34d4f2faa95b07c06a7d05d1dcae4dfbe11e5f08))
  > There was an issue where an Interactor would not emit the CollisionStopped event if the Interactor was disabled. This was due to the internal Interactor Rule becoming disabled and rules would always be rejected on disabled components.
  > 
  > A recent change in Zinnia now means the Rule can still be queried even if the component is on a deactivated GameObject. This fix simply allows the Rule within the Interactor to still be queried when the Interactor is disabled and therefore the CollisionStopped event still correctly emits.
